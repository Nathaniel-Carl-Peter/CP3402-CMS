## Content Insights

AWS(Amazon Web Services) has been used in this practical to host to the web.

As mention is the last prac, Amazon EC2 (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is one of the core services of AWS. It is scalable in which offers flexibility for capacity in the cloud in which is good for small,medium and even big services. It offers the users to manage instances(also known as virtual servers). It is great for admin for which the applications can be run on the cloud and lessen the burden the need to invest on physical hardware.

As for the CMS, Joomla is used, setup accompanied with a Database to pair with for the purpose to store website's content.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Just like the previous prac, one of the biggest benefits using AWS to host your site in contrast to using a CMS would be infrastracture and flexibility. Most CMS require the investment of physical hardware to host servers cloud computing systems like AWS and Microsoft Azure, the infrastucture is run in the cloud in which goes back to lessening the burden of requiring investment for physical hardware to build the needed infrastructure. The other advantage would be the flexibility. AWS intances are fully configurable and can  be easily resize making it flexible for small and medium size businesses while traditional CMS systems are stuck to one size and can be difficult to change.

This also go back to the benefits of cloud computing, a field of decent demand in which people seek for those who can:
    -Setting up the server
    -Configuring the server to meet client requirements and needs.
    -Security hardening(setting up Firewalls)

Can't really think of much to add but cloud computing seems to be one of the most highly demanded usage of technology of this day and age.

That's all for now.
