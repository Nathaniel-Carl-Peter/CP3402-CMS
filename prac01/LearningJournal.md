AWS(Amazon Web Services) has been used in this practical due to familiarity.

Amazon EC2 (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is one of the core services of AWS. It is scalable in which offers flexibility for capacity in the cloud in which is good for small,medium and even big services. It offers the users to manage instances(also known as virtual servers). It is great for admin for which the applications can be run on the cloud and lessen the burden the need to invest on physical hardware.

Child themes allow for the editing of existing themes without needing modify the main Theme. This allows for customization, without the worry of permanently editing the original design.
A child theme also allow for the edits to be saved and not be affected by updates to the theme.
If changes had be made to the original theme, then when an update comes out for the theme, these changes can be overwritten and lost.
However if a child theme was used instead, when these updates come out the changes can still be applied to the theme as they run off a separate file and the user doesn't have to worry about the changes they created being removed or needing to choose whether or not to update a theme or not.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

One of the biggest benefits using AWS to host your site in contrast to using a CMS would be infrastracture and flexibility. Most CMS require the investment of physical hardware to host servers cloud computing systems like AWS and Microsoft Azure, the infrastucture is run in the cloud in which goes back to lessening the burden of requiring investment for physical hardware to build the needed infrastructure. The other advantage would be the flexibility. AWS intances are fully configurable and can  be easily resize making it flexible for small and medium size businesses while traditional CMS systems are stuck to one size and can be difficult to change.

This also go back to the benefits of cloud computing, a field of decent demand in which people seek for those who can:
    -Setting up the server
    -Configuring the server to meet client requirements and needs.
    -Security hardening(setting up Firewalls)
